  ## Description
  ### The challenge for this project was the build a CMS style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developer's posts. This project is built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js at the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session npm package for authentication.

  ## Installation Instructions
  ### To run on your local machine, clone the repo then open in VSCode. Open the integrated terminal at the root server file and run npm install to install necessary dependencies. Run node server.js to start the server and view in your browser. 

  ## Usage
  ### When visiting the site, users should be able to see all posts from users on the main page. They have the ability to create an account with the signup link, login to see their own dashboard of posts, comment on other posts, and delete their own posts.
